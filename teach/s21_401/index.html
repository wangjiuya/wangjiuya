<h4> Some Suggestions</h4>
<ul>
<li> Write your homework using latex: since most of you have science majors (math, cs, economics, etc), it is likely that you will inevitably use latex in your future study. It is good to learn how to write in latex early, and keep all of your homework in a good form is rewarding. <br>
<li> Discuss with your classmates: this includes asking questions to other people and answering questions for other people, you will soon find that both ways of communication benefit you.<br>
<li> Do not hesitate to reach out when you start to feel you have difficulties. <br>
