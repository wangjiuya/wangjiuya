     <li> We defined Aut(K/F)/normal extension/Galois extensions over Q/Galois group of a Galois extension.

     <ul>
     <li> We proved that F/Q is Galois if and only if F is the splitting field for some polynomials in Q. 
     <li> We showed that the Galois group of a polynomial (Galois group of its splitting field) is naturally embedded into S_n where n is the degree. 
     <li> We proved (pretty hasty, the proof will not show up as part of the final exam, do not worry!) that if a polynomial is solvable with radicals, then the splitting field is solvable. This implies that when degree of f is greater or equal to 5, f generally cannot be solved with radicals!!
     </ul>
 
<li> April 27: Final Exam
     <ul>
     <li> There will be 10 problems (open books), for 4 hours in a total (1:30 pm to 5:30 pm, one more hour than what is shown in the system for you to download/submit/etc.)
     <li> I will be at the zoom during the exam but you don't need to be on the zoom, if there are typos in the exam, I will send emails to everyone. 
     <li> We will have the regular office hour on Thursday 11:00 am.
       </ul>
Good luck! Let me know if you have other questions about the arrangement of exams.
